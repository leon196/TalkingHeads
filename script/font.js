var text = " hi there !    you are playing to talking heads    \
a game about information circulation.    \
drag and drop heads and build a complete circuit to start a new game     \
the levels are procedural and infinite      \
there is no ending      \
for now there is only one drawing reward when you go the next level     \
but i will try to provide more content not too late      \
also i dont really had time to make up a story or something     \
so the text is kind of place holder.    \
any writer feeling up to make up a story is welcome    \
it could be also a input text field so you can tell whatever you want !    \
anyway thank you for playing !     \
and big love for ludum darers     \

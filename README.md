Talking Heads is a game about information circulation.
Drag and drop heads to build a circuit that translates letters.

Here is a gif of the mechanic : http://i.imgur.com/QYH9Zs5.gif
If all the heads are connected with the last ear, you start a new level.

The compo version have only one level.
In the post compo version the levels are procedural and infinite

The game currently lack of level design elements to make a challenge progression.
Need to find out a simple idea and may be create some hand made levels.
For now there is only one drawing reward when you go the next level, but i will try to provide more content not too late.

Coded in HTML5 with Pixi.js
